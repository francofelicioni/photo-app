# Welcome to Phgrm.

This project was developed with React, React Router Dom and Redux Toolkit.

It is a 100% responsive SPA website, where I use the Unsplash API, in which the user can search for images, save them to favorites, add/change their description, order them at will and even download them to their dispositive.
